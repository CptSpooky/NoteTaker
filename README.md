  Note Taker is an app that allows the user to save notes as well as delete them. After utilizing express, path, and fs dependencies I used a series of get and post routes to manage client-to-server and server-to-client data. Pages are fed to the user, user input is saved on the server and called when needed- as well as deleted. This is the function of the server.js file. The index.js file deals with client side management like what happens on clicks, creating IDs for notes to be accessed on the backend, etc.

  ## Installation
  To install, you just need to download the files, go into your terminal and make sure you're in the right directory, have node.js installed, then run 'npm i'. That should install all modules. 

  ## Usage
  To run a local instance, use your terminal to get into the same directory as the server.js file, run with 'nodemon server.js'. Otherwise checkout the Heroku link.
